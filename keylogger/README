These scripts can be used to log all keypresses under linux, and produce some
statistics based on the data.

You may need to change the /dev/input/ device in keylogger.pl for your system.

To log key presses run keylogger.pl as root (or some other user with permission
to read the /dev/input device set in keylogger.pl),

    sudo ./keylogger.pl

This will create a logfile. Then run

    ./print_stats.pl logfile.log

to get a summary of the data. You may need to change the keycode mappings in
print_stats.pl for your keyboard.
