#This script does mass downloading of map tiles served in an openstreetmap style.
#You'll need to change the source to change the paramaters of the download,
#so its not meant to be an off the shelf solution.
#Dependencies: You need wget installed.
#              Only tested on linux.

#This code is in the public domain.

#At the time of writting the imagery this code is designed to download is 
#governed by the licence terms at 
#http://www.nearmap.com/legal/community-licence.aspx

#They have also stated that they are okay with this kind of mass downloading.
#Q. Can I download photo tiles for my own use?
#A. Yes. You can use all tiles for personal use under the terms of our 
#Community (Personal) Licence.

#Q. Can I download lots of tiles?
#A. Yes; if you abide by our licence agreements. However if you download a large
#amount of data from our servers, we may have to limit your speeds in order to 
#give everyone fair access to the site. Please be considerate of everyone else 
#when youâ€™re thinking of downloading a large amount of data.
